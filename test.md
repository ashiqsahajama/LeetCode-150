# 💡 Project Idea: AI Agent for RFP Suitability Analysis

## 📌 Objective
Build an **AI agent using LangChain** that evaluates whether a given RFP (Request for Proposal) aligns with your company’s capabilities. The agent will output a **suitability score** and a **natural language explanation**.

---

## 🧠 Key Features
- **Input**:
  - RFP document (text or chunks)
  - Pre-embedded company profile
- **Output**:
  - Suitability score (0–100)
  - Explanation (e.g., matched on healthcare domain, lacks FHIR certification)

---

## 🔧 Core Components
- **LangChain**: To orchestrate the flow (input → retrieval → LLM → output)
- **Embeddings**: Used to match RFP content with company profile (handled externally)
- **Retriever (e.g., FAISS)**: Retrieves the most relevant RFP sections based on profile
- **LLM**: Analyzes and reasons over retrieved content to generate score and explanation

---

## 🧮 Sample Flow
1. Load RFP document and split into chunks
2. Use embedded company profile to query top relevant chunks
3. Prompt LLM with:  
   “Given the company profile and the following RFP sections, score project suitability from 0–100 and explain why.”
4. Return output to user

## 🧱 Technologies
- **LangChain**
- **FAISS** (or similar retriever)
- **LLM provider** (e.g., OpenAI, Claude)
- **Embeddings provider** (OpenAI, HuggingFace)
